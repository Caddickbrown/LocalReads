## Import Guide

### Grouping and order
Keep imports in these groups, in this order:
1) External libraries (React, third‚Äëparty)
2) Absolute project imports using the `@/` alias
3) Relative imports (`./`, `../`), ordered by proximity

Within each group:
- Put side‚Äëeffect imports at the very top of the group (rare; CSS/global once in `main.tsx`)
- Sort imports alphabetically by module specifier when reasonable
- Prefer named imports; default imports only when required by the library
- Split out type‚Äëonly imports with `import type` when it improves clarity

Path alias is configured in `tsconfig.json` as `@/*` ‚Üí `src/*`. Prefer the alias instead of deep relative paths.

### Quick examples

Component with external, alias, and relative imports:
```ts
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react'
import { save, open } from '@tauri-apps/plugin-dialog'

import Dashboard from '@/components/Dashboard'
import { listBooks } from '@/db/repo'
import type { Book } from '@/types'

import { Card, Button } from './ui'
```

### Import formats overview

| Category | Example | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| External libraries | `import React, { useState } from 'react'` | React, charts, icons, etc. |
| Tauri plugins | `import { save } from '@tauri-apps/plugin-dialog'` | Prefer named APIs needed per file. |
| App alias `@/` | `import { listBooks } from '@/db/repo'` | Use alias instead of deep relative paths. |
| Types (alias) | `import type { Book, Read } from '@/types'` | Use `import type` to avoid including code. |
| Relative (same dir) | `import { Card } from './ui'` | Keep near the bottom group. |
| Relative (parent) | `import EditDialog from '../EditDialog'` | Avoid long chains by using `@/` where possible. |

### CSV formats

#### Highlights CSV

Headers (preferred):
```csv
id,book,author,text,created_at
```

Minimal headers (alternate):
```csv
title,text
```

Example (preferred headers):
```csv
id,book,author,text,created_at
h_9g7k2m1a,The Hobbit,J. R. R. Tolkien,"So comes snow after fire, and even dragons have their endings.",2024-10-05 12:34:56
h_1x2y3z4a,The Fellowship of the Ring,J. R. R. Tolkien,"Not all those who wander are lost.",
```

Example (alternate headers using `title` instead of `book`):
```csv
id,title,author,text,created_at
h_ab12cd34,The Two Towers,J. R. R. Tolkien,"There is some good in this world, and it's worth fighting for.",
```

Sample (table view for readability):

| id | book | author | text | created_at |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| h_9g7k2m1a | The Hobbit | J. R. R. Tolkien | So comes snow after fire, and even dragons have their endings. | 2024-10-05 12:34:56 |
| h_1x2y3z4a | The Fellowship of the Ring | J. R. R. Tolkien | Not all those who wander are lost. | |

Rules:
- Required fields: `text` plus either `book` or `title`.
- If `book`/`title` doesn‚Äôt match an existing book, it will be created automatically.
- `id` and `created_at` are optional. If `id` is missing, it‚Äôs generated.
- Commas and quotes inside `text` are supported via CSV quoting. Avoid line breaks inside a single cell.

#### Library CSV

Headers (as exported):
```csv
title,author,seriesName,seriesNumber,obtained,type,status,tags,latestStart,latestEnd,latestRating,latestReview,highlightsCount
```

Example:
```csv
title,author,seriesName,seriesNumber,obtained,type,status,tags,latestStart,latestEnd,latestRating,latestReview,highlightsCount
The Hobbit,J. R. R. Tolkien,,,"Owned",Book,Finished,,2024-01-01,2024-01-05,5,"Great adventure",2
Mistborn,Brandon Sanderson,Mistborn,1,,Ebook,To Read,"fantasy;epic",,,,,0
```

Type‚Äëonly imports:
```ts
import type { Read } from '@/types'
```

Side‚Äëeffect imports (keep to a minimum):
```ts
// Only once globally (already done in src/main.tsx)
import './styles/index.css'
```

### Do / Don‚Äôt
- Do: use `@/` alias for project modules
- Do: group and order consistently
- Do: use `import type` for type‚Äëonly imports to avoid bundling code unintentionally
- Don‚Äôt: use long chains of relative paths when an alias is available
- Don‚Äôt: add file extensions for TS/TSX imports
- Don‚Äôt: add per‚Äëcomponent CSS imports; Tailwind styles are global via `src/main.tsx`
